git init :-
* The word init means initialize. The command sets up all the tools Git needs to begin tracking changes made to the project.
* The git init command creates or initializes a new Git project, or repository. It creates a .git folder with all the tools and data necessary to maintain versions. This command only needs to be used once per project to complete the initial setup. For instance, the code block sets up the home folder as a new git repository.
* When you use git init and initialize a repo, you’re officially making a Git project and can now make use of all the git commands in the world! If you’re not inside of a git repo, you won’t be able to use git commands and the terminal will complain to you about it.


git status:-
* The git status command is used within a Git repository to its current status including the current commit, any modified files, and any new files not being tracked by Git.

Git Workflow:-
* A Working Directory: where you’ll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files
* A Staging Area: where you’ll list changes you make to the working directory
* A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project


//The Git workflow consists of editing files in the working directory, adding files to the staging area, and saving changes to a Git repository. In Git, we save changes with a commit, which we will learn more about in this lesson.
